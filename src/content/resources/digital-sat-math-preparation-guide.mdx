# How to Prepare for the Digital SAT Math Section: A Complete Guide

The Digital SAT Math section has undergone significant changes from the paper version. This comprehensive guide will help you understand the new format and prepare effectively for success.

## Understanding the Digital SAT Math Format

The Digital SAT Math section consists of two modules:
- Module 1: 22 questions in 35 minutes
- Module 2: Questions and difficulty level adapt based on your performance in Module 1

Key features:
- Built-in Desmos calculator available for all math questions
- Questions appear one at a time
- You can mark questions for review and return to them within the same module
- No grid-in questions; all questions are multiple-choice

## Key Topics Covered

### Algebra and Functions
- Linear equations and inequalities
- Systems of equations
- Quadratic equations
- Exponential functions
- Function notation and interpretation
- Rational expressions and equations

### Problem Solving and Data Analysis
- Ratios, rates, and proportions
- Percentages
- Units and unit conversion
- Data interpretation from graphs and tables
- Mean, median, mode, and range
- Probability and statistics

### Advanced Math
- Polynomial operations
- Quadratic and exponential relationships
- Trigonometric ratios
- Complex numbers
- Rational exponents

### Geometry and Trigonometry
- Area and volume
- Lines, angles, and triangles
- Circle properties
- Trigonometric ratios in right triangles
- Coordinate geometry

## Essential Study Strategies

### 1. Master the Digital Tools
- Practice extensively with the Desmos calculator
- Familiarize yourself with the digital interface
- Learn keyboard shortcuts for efficient navigation

### 2. Time Management
- Practice with timed sections
- Allocate approximately 1.5 minutes per question
